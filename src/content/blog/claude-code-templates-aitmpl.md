Claude Code is powerful, but getting it configured for your specific workflow takes time. Writing custom agents, commands, hooks, and settings from scratch means researching best practices, understanding the API, and iterating until it works.

**Claude Code Templates** solves this.

Created by [davila7](https://github.com/davila7) (Daniel Avila), [Claude Code Templates](https://www.aitmpl.com/) is a platform providing **400+ ready-to-use components** across eight categories: agents, commands, settings, hooks, MCPs, plugins, skills, and project templates. Browse at [aitmpl.com](https://www.aitmpl.com/), select what you need, and install with a single CLI command.

With **11.8k GitHub stars** and **1k forks**, it's become the go-to resource for accelerating Claude Code adoption. Instead of spending hours configuring, you spend minutes installing tested, community-curated components.

## What You Get

### 400+ Components Across 8 Categories

**🤖 Agents (100+)**: Pre-built AI agents for specific roles and tasks. Examples include frontend developers, backend engineers, data scientists, and DevOps specialists. Each agent comes with optimized prompts and toolsets for their domain.

**⚡ Commands (159+)**: Custom slash commands that extend Claude Code's functionality. From project scaffolding to code analysis, these commands streamline common workflows.

**⚙️ Settings**: Configuration presets for different project types and team setups. Skip the trial-and-error of finding optimal settings.

**🪝 Hooks**: Workflow automation that triggers on specific events. Automate linting, testing, documentation generation, or any repetitive task.

**🔌 MCPs (Model Context Protocol)**: External integrations connecting Claude Code to databases, APIs, cloud services, and third-party tools.

**🧩 Plugins**: Extensions that add new capabilities beyond the core feature set.

**🎨 Skills**: Specialized capabilities for specific domains like frontend design, API development, or data analysis.

**📦 Templates**: Full project templates for popular frameworks—React, Vue, Angular, Django, FastAPI, Ruby on Rails, and more. Start projects with Claude Code configurations already in place.

### Stack Builder

The site's visual **Stack Builder** lets you select components and generate a custom installation command. Pick the agents, commands, and templates you need, and the builder creates a single `npx` command that installs everything at once.

You can also share your stack configuration on social media, making it easy for teams to standardize their Claude Code setups.

### Analytics and Monitoring

Beyond templates, the platform includes advanced features:

- **Claude Code Analytics**: Dashboard showing performance metrics and usage patterns
- **Health Check**: Diagnostics tool for optimizing your Claude Code installation
- **Conversation Monitor**: Real-time analysis of Claude responses with remote access via Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Plugin Dashboard**: Visual component management with granular permissions control

These tools help you understand how Claude Code is performing and identify optimization opportunities.

## Why This Matters

### Removes the Configuration Barrier

Claude Code's power comes from customization, but customization requires time and expertise. Claude Code Templates removes that barrier. New users can start with proven configurations instead of empty config files. Experienced users can browse components to discover new patterns and integrations.

### Best Practices Baked In

The templates aren't just quick solutions—they're **community-curated**. With 27 contributors and input from thousands of users, the configurations reflect real-world usage patterns and battle-tested approaches.

The project integrates components from **awesome-claude-code**, ensuring alignment with the broader ecosystem's standards.

### Progressive Disclosure

Power users can install components directly via CLI with specific flags. Beginners can browse visually at aitmpl.com and use the Stack Builder. The platform meets users at their skill level without compromising depth.

### Ecosystem Integration

Claude Code Templates doesn't exist in isolation. It incorporates the best components from the Claude Code ecosystem, making it a central hub for discovery. If a useful agent, command, or hook exists, it's likely cataloged here.
