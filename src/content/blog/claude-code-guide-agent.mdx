Claude Code v2.0.49 added something interesting: a **claude-code-guide subagent** designed to "improve Claude Code's ability to know how to use itself."

It's a meta-agent that helps Claude understand Claude Code.

## What It Does

The claude-code-guide agent is a specialized subagent that activates when you ask Claude Code questions about... Claude Code.

**Triggers**:
- "Can Claude Code do...?"
- "Does Claude Code have...?"
- "How do I implement [hooks/slash commands/MCP servers]?"
- Questions about Claude Agent SDK architecture

Instead of Claude guessing or falling back on general knowledge, it now spawns a dedicated agent that:

1. **Fetches documentation maps** for Claude Code and the Agent SDK
2. **Identifies relevant resources** across categories (Getting Started, Features, customization, MCP Integration, configuration)
3. **Retrieves specific documentation pages** to answer your question
4. **References local project files** (CLAUDE.md, .claude/ directory) when applicable
5. **Provides actionable guidance** grounded in official docs

## Why This Matters

Before this, Claude Code would answer questions about its own features based on training data—which could be outdated or incomplete. Now it looks up current documentation.

The agent acts like a documentation-aware assistant that:
- Knows the latest features
- Can explain keyboard shortcuts
- Walks you through hook implementation
- Guides MCP server setup
- References the Agent SDK correctly

## How It Works Under the Hood

Based on the [system prompts repository](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts), the agent uses:

- **589 tokens** for the main agent prompt
- **123 tokens** for the whenToUse criteria

**Smart resuming**: Before spawning a new guide agent, Claude checks if there's a recently completed one it can resume. This maintains context from previous documentation lookups and avoids redundant fetches.

## The Quiet Launch

What's interesting: v2.0.49's changelog doesn't mention this agent. The official changelog lists:
- Added readline-style ctrl-y for pasting deleted text
- Improved clarity of usage limit warning message
- Fixed handling of subagent permissions

No mention of claude-code-guide.

This was discovered by examining the [system prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts/blob/main/system-prompts/agent-prompt-claude-code-guide-agent.md) rather than official release notes.

It was also featured on twitter by an Anthropic employee:

## Try It Yourself

Ask Claude Code a meta question:

```
"What hooks are available in Claude Code?"
```

```
"How do I create a custom slash command?"
```

```
"Can you explain how MCP servers work?"
```

You might notice Claude fetching documentation before answering. That's the guide agent at work.

## What This Reveals

This is part of a broader pattern: Claude Code is becoming more **self-aware** about its capabilities. Instead of relying on pre-training knowledge (which gets stale), specialized agents fetch current documentation.

It's recursive improvement: Claude Code using Claude Code features (subagents, web fetching, documentation parsing) to understand itself better.

And it works. The next time you're confused about a Claude Code feature, just ask. There's now an agent whose entire job is knowing the answer.
